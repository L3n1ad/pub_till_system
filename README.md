# pub_till_system

Our first all day lab projects during our CodeClan course. It was our very first experience
to write a bit of a logic to create a pub till system. The app has test for fuctions to be 
able to sell alcohol when customers money should go down and pub's total should go up. It 
also has logic to check if customers alcohol level is to high or low enough to be able to buy
more alocohol.
